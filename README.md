<h1>Security Monitoring for DVWA</h1>
This project implements a security monitoring solution for DVWA. It identifies common security threats, defines logging and monitoring requirements with thresholds, and utilizes a chosen tool for ongoing monitoring. The project also outlines a Security Incident Response Process (SIRP) for handling potential security incidents.

Key Features:
- Identifies and documents common security threats for the target software/URL.
- Defines logging and monitoring requirements for effective security posture.
- Analyzes existing logs (if applicable) to set appropriate thresholds for triggering alerts.
- Implements a security monitoring tool with defined scenarios and thresholds for monitoring critical events.
- Provides a documented Security Incident Response Process (SIRP) for incident handling.
- (Optional) Integrates "self-healing" functionalities for automated response to specific security threats.
